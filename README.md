# Webpack Basics

[![N|Solid](https://i.blogs.es/a4a869/webpack/original.png)](https://webpack.github.io/)

Just a basic exercise to get started with webpack.
Try to do the following: 

  - Get a local copy of this repo.
  - Get webpack (dev server) up and running, with the dist/index.html as the root.
  - Get all .js files for the listed components (footer and header) inside the 'scr' folder into the single 'dist/assests/bundle.js' file.

  Cool, you are done! You can move to the next exercise.
