Just a basic excersice to get started with webpack.
Try to do the following: 

  - Get webpack (dev server) up and running, with the dist/index.html as the root.
  - Get all .js files for the listed components (footer and header) inside the 'scr' folder into the single 'dist/assests/bundle.js' file.
